- 👋 Hi, I’m Cyn. I've been known as [TechnoMom](https://technomom.com) since 1995, when my manager at MindSpring put that on business cards as my title.
- 👀 I’m a technical support engineer, an inveterate geek, and always interested in finding better ways to help people.
- 🌱 I’m learning to code! Python, JavaScript, and a little R. I've used HTML and CSS for years, but I've been brushing up on those, as well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects. I have experience in technical writing and QA, so while I'm not much of a coder yet I do have useful skills.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me! technomom at gmail works.
- :grin: Pronouns: she/her
- :zap: Fun fact: I was a guest on Oprah years ago to talk about internet safety and cyberstalking
