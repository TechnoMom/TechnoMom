- 👋 Hi, I’m @TechnoMom, aka Cyn. I've been TechnoMom online since 1995!
- 👀 I’m a technical support geek and always interested in finding better ways to help people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code! Mostly JavaScript, although I've dabbled in Python and stuck my toe in the waters of R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects. I have experience in technical writing and QA, so while I'm not much of a coder yet I do have useful skills.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me! technomom at gmail works.
