# Good Day!

## About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m Cyn. I've been known as [TechnoMom](https://technomom.com/) since 1995, when my manager at MindSpring put that title on my business cards.
- 👀 I’m a senior customer solutions engineer, an inveterate geek, and always interested in finding better ways to help people.
- 🌱 I’m learning to code! Python, JavaScript, and a little R. I've used HTML and CSS for many years, but I've been brushing up on those, as well.
- ⌨️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects. I have experience in technical writing and QA, so while I'm not much of a coder yet I do have useful skills.
- 💜 My personal interests include 🎶 making music (I'm a singer), 📚 reading (mostly SF&F and non-fiction), 🪡 needlework (blackwork lately, but also cross-stitch, knitting, and crochet 🧶), 🎲 playing tabletop RPGs (particularly story games), and 🫶 volunteering (mostly digital lately, but my husband and I also foster 🐈 kittens that are too young for adoption).
- 🏡 I began working from home in 1990, when it was much more difficult than it is now
- 📫 How to reach me: email me! cyn at technomom dot com works.
- :grin: Pronouns: she/her/hers
- :zap: Fun fact: I was once featured as a guest on Oprah to talk about internet safety and cyberstalking
