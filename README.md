# Good Day!

## About Me
- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Cyn. I've been known as [TechnoMom](https://technomom.com/) since 1995, when my manager at MindSpring put that title on my business cards.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm a senior customer solutions engineer, an inveterate geek, and always interested in finding better ways to help people.
- üå± I‚Äôm learning to code! Python, JavaScript, and a little R. I've used HTML and CSS for years, but I've been brushing up on those, as well.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on interesting projects. I have experience in technical writing and QA, so while I'm not much of a coder yet I do have useful skills.
- üì´ How to reach me: email me! technomom at gmail works.
- :grin: Pronouns: she/her
- :zap: Fun fact: I was a guest on Oprah years ago to talk about internet safety and cyberstalking
